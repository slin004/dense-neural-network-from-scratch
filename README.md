# Dense Neural Network From Scratch

## Step by step naive implementation of densely connected neural network:
- [x] forward operations
- [x] load params from files
- [x] gradient dsec
- [x] params update
- [x] batch processing
- [x] accuracy
- [x] momentum gradient
- [x] 14_100_40_4 network
- [x] 14_28x6_4 network
- [x] 14_14x28_4 network
- [ ] plotting
- [ ] gradient checking
- [ ] add description how to do it step by step
